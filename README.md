# Certificate-of-participation-EEML2020

This year I attended Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School. The Summer School did something great â€“ it uncovered my potential and provided me with a strong theoretical basis in both fundamental and advanced topics related to machine learning, gave me a good understanding of basic and some more advanced notions in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, from understand what are the open questions in the field and to what are the emergent topics are. I became exposed to some of the theoretical underpinnings and latest developments in the theoretical study of deep neural networks, knowing by hand what good practices for setting up learning experiments (e.g., getting baselines, hyper-pram tuning, etc.) are, increasing my awareness in analyzing and diagnosing network behavior (e.g., overfitting) and offering me the opportunity to gain visibility and network with peers and top researchers in the field like Doina Precup, Razvan Pascanu, Viorica Patraucean and Yoshua Bengio while under the direct mentorship of Oriol Vinyals through social events and poster sessions.
